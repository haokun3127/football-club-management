# App Client BFF Contracts

## Scenario: Mini-Program P0 BFF

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: any WeChat mini-program route under `/clubs/:clubId/app-clients/:clientId/...`.
- These routes are the only frontend-facing BFF surface for parent/coach mini-program flows.
- Mini-program code must not call admin APIs or infer business fields from WPS table shape.

### 2. Signatures

- `POST /clubs/:clubId/app-clients/:clientId/wechat-login`
- `GET /clubs/:clubId/app-clients/:clientId/parent/calendar?from=&to=`
- `GET /clubs/:clubId/app-clients/:clientId/coach/training-project-tree`
- `PUT /clubs/:clubId/app-clients/:clientId/coach/events/:eventId/training-projects`

### 3. Contracts

- Login may accept `roleHint` as UI context only. It is never authoritative.
- Authoritative role comes from active club membership, and must be checked against `ClubAppClient.roleEntrypoints`.
- Parent calendar responses must be scoped by guardian binding and must not expose unrelated event participants.
- Coach training project tree comes from the backend training catalog derived from assessment/training configuration.
- Training project writes must verify coach event access and should be sent with `Idempotency-Key`.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- Missing or inactive app client -> `404 not_found`.
- Authenticated role not exposed by app client -> `403 forbidden`.
- Parent calendar requested by non-parent -> `403 forbidden`.
- Coach write without event access -> `403 forbidden`.
- Training project write on a non-training event -> `400 invalid_training_event`.
- Unknown training project id -> `400 invalid_training_project`.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: parent with two bound children receives one merged calendar list with only those children in `participants`.
- Base: coach saves two catalog project ids to a training event and receives `trainingSession.sessionPlanId`.
- Bad: frontend passes `roleHint: "parent"` for a coach membership and expects parent privileges. Backend must still return coach role or reject by app client entrypoint.

### 6. Tests Required

- OpenAPI path exists for each app-client BFF route.
- Parent calendar test asserts participant redaction to bound children.
- Training project tree test asserts catalog projects from CQ Talent assessment/training seed.
- Training project write test asserts event access, session plan id, block drill ids, and idempotency header.
- Login test asserts `roleHint` does not override membership-derived role.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```typescript
const role = request.body.roleHint ?? "parent";
```

#### Correct

```typescript
const role = resolveAppRole(auth.membership.roles);
const entrypoints = client.roleEntrypoints?.[role];
```
