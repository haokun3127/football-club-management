# Execution Plan

## Validation baseline

- Mini-program targeted tests for each touched page and utilities.
- API route tests covering timeline, match detail, assessment task/project rows, and saved assessment linkage.
- `npx --yes pnpm@10.33.0 run check` when the final full-scope change is ready; report the two known unrelated blockers precisely if they remain.
- `git diff --check` before every commit.

## Ordered batches

1. **Figma V7 design first**: complete — non-destructive Parent V7 nodes `1967:2` / `1967:164` / `1967:198` and Coach V7 nodes `1973:2` / `1973:91` / `1973:131` / `1973:181` / `1973:302` were written and screenshot-read back.
2. **Parent timeline data and navigation**: in progress — API and page tests now cover per-lesson progress; the first unit exposes and renders it. Ability-history navigation is complete and its dedicated page is implemented; match-detail navigation remains for the next unit.
3. **Parent visual cleanup**: add page-level tests for card classes and view-model fields, remove the Growth card border artifact, align the full-screen history and match detail layouts to V7, then commit.
4. **Coach visual shell**: add failing page tests, repair fixed top bars/back controls/radar dimensions/FAB safe-area clearance, then commit.
5. **Coach bulk project entry**: add failing route/view-model tests, add project chooser and roster batch page with task+project drafts and save/next actions, use the current assessment API contract, then commit.
6. **Integration and documentation**: run targeted suites and full gate, inspect diffs, update Figma source/progress/task records, make a final limited-path documentation commit, and push each work commit to `origin/dev`.

## High-risk files

- `apps/api/src/routes/app-client.routes.ts`: preserve role authorization and existing response compatibility.
- `apps/miniprogram-cq-talent/pages/parent/growth/*`, `milestones/*`, `match-history/*`, `event/*`: do not put array transforms in WXML.
- `apps/miniprogram-cq-talent/pages/coach/test-tasks/*`, `test-entry/*`, `assessment-entry/*`, `team-ability/*`, `student-radar/*`: keep fixed controls above `role-tabbar` and safe-area padding.
